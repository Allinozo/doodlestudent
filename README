# Remote meeting planing

This project is used in a course on the *ops* part at the University of Rennes, France. It is a kind of doodle clone developed in so-called "native cloud" technologies in order to allow students to work on a continuous deployment chain in a containerized environment. 

- The [back](https://github.com/barais/doodlestudent/tree/main/api) is developed using the [quarkus.io](https://quarkus.io/) framework. 
- The [front](https://github.com/barais/doodlestudent/tree/main/front) is developed in [angular](https://angular.io/) using the [primeng](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/)  angular UI component library and the [fullcalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) graphical component. 

Three videos (in french) that present the [application feature]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GQbdgq2CHcddTlcoHqM5Zc8Dw5o_eeLg/preview), its [architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5UAsU5_q-oshwEW6edZ4UvQjN3-tzwi/preview) and a [short code review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxYNfJdtd4r_pDbOthra360ei8Z17tX_/preview) are available.
